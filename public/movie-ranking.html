<h1>Best Movies According to Bob</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>One of my favourite superhero movies, it's really unique and I really don't need to say much about Heath Ledger's joker and also Christian Bale's Batman potrayal.</p>

<h3>Hangover</h3>
<p>This movie is just hilarious, I have watched it multiple times and it never gets old. The plot is really funny and the characters are really well developed.</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>This movie is a masterpiece, the war scenes are really well done and the story is really touching. Tom Hanks did an amazing job in this movie.</p>
